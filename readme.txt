Implements a JSON feed following the version 1 spec by means of a REST API endpoint.

== Description ==

* Adds JSON feeds following the official [version 1 spec](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1).
* Places a link tag to the posts feed inside the HTML head tag.
* Adds a new namespace `feed/v1` to the REST API.
* Allows adding individual endpoints per post type, simply by specifying an additional argument when registering the post type. By default a feed is only added for regular posts (posts of the `post` post type).
* Uses a proper REST API controller including schema for the endpoints.
* Contains several filters to modify the feed responses as necessary.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `wp-api-json-feed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or download it through the WordPress backend.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Once the plugin is activated, it will work out of the box and provide a JSON feed for posts. If you want to provide JSON feeds for further post types, you need to specify an additional argument `show_json_feed` when registering the post type, and set it to a boolean `true`. You may also specify a `json_feed_base` argument being a string identifier that should be used in the feed URL. If no string identifier is provided, the post type slug will be used.
