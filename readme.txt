Implements a JSON feed following the official JSON feed specification by means of a REST API endpoint.

== Description ==

* Adds JSON feeds following the official [version 1.1 spec](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1).
* Places a link tag to the posts feed inside the HTML head tag.
* Adds a new namespace `feed/v1` to the REST API.
* Allows adding individual endpoints per post type, simply by specifying an additional argument when registering the post type. By default a feed is only added for regular posts (posts of the `post` post type).
* Uses a proper REST API controller including schema for the endpoints.
* Contains several filters to modify the feed responses as necessary.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `wp-api-json-feed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or download it through the WordPress backend.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Administration =

Once the plugin is activated, it will work out of the box and provide a JSON feed for posts. If you want to provide JSON feeds for further post types, you need to specify an additional argument `show_json_feed` when registering the post type, and set it to a boolean `true`. You may also specify a `json_feed_base` argument being a string identifier that should be used in the feed URL. If no string identifier is provided, the post type slug will be used.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I add a feed for my custom post type? =

If you want to provide a JSON feed for your custom post type, you need to specify an additional argument `show_json_feed` when registering the post type, and set it to a boolean `true`. You may also specify a `json_feed_base` argument being a string identifier that should be used in the feed URL. If no string identifier is provided, the post type slug will be used.

= Why does the JSON feed contain fields which are not part of the schema? =

Since the JSON feed schema is always future compatible, by default the plugin preserves backward compatibility with older JSON feed readers by maintaining deprecated fields such as `author`. You can skip this backward compatibility behavior by using the `wp_api_json_feed_skip_backward_compatibility` filter and returning `true`.
