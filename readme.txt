Implements JSON feeds following the official JSON feed specification by using the WordPress REST API.

== Description ==

Implements JSON feeds following the official JSON feed specification by using the WordPress REST API. By default, only a JSON feed for regular posts is added. This can be easily customized to also provide JSON feeds for e.g. certain custom post types.

* Adds JSON feeds following the official [version 1.1 spec](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1).
* Adds a JSON feed for posts to the REST API by default (e.g. at `/wp-json/feed/v1/posts`).
* Allows adding JSON feeds for other post types by using a `show_json_feed` argument when registering the post type.
* Places a link tag to the current feed inside the HTML head tag.
* Maintains backward compatibility with the previous JSON feed [version 1 spec](https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1/).
* Contains extensive filters to modify the feed responses as necessary.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `wp-api-json-feed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or download it through the WordPress backend.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Administration =

Once the plugin is activated, it will work out of the box and provide a JSON feed for posts. If you want to provide JSON feeds for further post types, you need to specify an additional argument `show_json_feed` when registering the post type, and set it to a boolean `true`. You may also specify a `json_feed_base` argument being a string identifier that should be used in the feed URL. If no string identifier is provided, the post type slug will be used.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I add a feed for my custom post type? =

To provide a JSON feed for your custom post type, you need to specify an additional argument `show_json_feed` when registering the post type, and set it to a boolean `true`. You may optionally specify a `json_feed_base` argument being a string identifier that should be used in the feed URL. If no string identifier is provided, the post type slug will be used.

Here is an example, supporting a JSON feed for a custom post type "article" and setting its feed base to "articles" so that the feed will appear at `{restURL}/feed/v1/articles`.

`
<?php

add_filter(
	'register_post_type_args',
	function ( $args, $post_type ) {
		if ( 'article' === $post_type ) {
			$args['show_json_feed'] = true;
			$args['json_feed_base'] = 'articles';
		}
		return $args;
	},
	10,
	2
);

`

= Why does the JSON feed contain fields which are not part of the schema? =

Since the JSON feed schema is always future compatible, by default the plugin preserves backward compatibility with older JSON feed readers by maintaining deprecated fields such as `author`. You can skip this backward compatibility behavior by using the `wp_api_json_feed_skip_backward_compatibility` filter and returning `true`.

= Where should I submit my support request? =
